This assignment went ok for me.  It is a good learning experience about creating my own repository and adding my own contents to the repository is very satisfying.  Even though from wats3010 that I learn some materials from github but this assignment showed me a couple of new things such as adding a coding element to my repository.  It took me about 30 minutes or so to complete this assingment.  The part give me trouble was adding the markdown code to make my poem become a list instead of paragraph.  I have to make sure to add a space after the dash so that the list can be formed.
