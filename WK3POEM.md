 # The Ox
 
 - Here is a tale for farmer and for peasant:
 - There was an ox, who might have ploughed for Jason,
 - *So strong was he*, his huge head like a bason,
 - A Gothic helmet with enormous crescent.
 - **Stolid of look and slow of hoof and steady,**
 - Meek was the beast and born but to be driven,
 - Unmindful of the yoke which toil had given,
 - Toil with his goad and lash for ever ready.
 - One day a bull, who was the bullock's neighbor,
 - Proud as a sultan haremed with his women,
 - Lowed to the ox who had received a beating:
 - "You are a fool! What have you for your labour?
 - Blows and bad food! Go to. Why don't you show men?"
 - ***The ox was but an ox and went on eating.***
